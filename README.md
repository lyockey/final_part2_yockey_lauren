## Resources

* [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)

    My usual reference for making sure editor configuration properties are written accurately.

* [Canvas - Responsive Transformation Module](https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/330762/pages/hands-on-responsive-transformation?module_item_id=6205785)

    This module is SUPER helpful. Thanks for including the walk-through on this page! I referenced it many times, particular for grabbing the `meta viewport` tag and just making sure my document was semantic.

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css)

    For the `.visuallyhidden` properties.
* [Hubspot](http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/snippets/design/centering-your-website-using-max-width-and-auto-margins)

    I read through this tutorial when I ran into a few bugs involving centering my site container. For some reason I had a few things that just weren't cooperation `margin:auto` -wise, so this was helpful. I don't know that I actually implemented anything from this tutorial, but it was still handy advice.

* [W3CSchools - CSS Gradient](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp)

    So I could remember how to write gradient background properties.

* [CSS3 Generator](http://css3generator.com/)

    I used this site for various CSS3 properties, namely `border-radius` and `box-shadow` effects.

* [CSS-Tricks - Using @font-face](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/)

    I use Google Fonts so frequently that I tend to forget how to import fonts, especially when I need to use additional fallbacks.

* [Online Font Converter](https://onlinefontconverter.com/)

    This is the font converter I used for creating additional fallback font types.

* [Romance Fatal Serif](http://www.dafont.com/romance-fatal-serif.font)

    The heading font I used.

# Comments

As you can tell, the final version of my style prototype is quite a bit different than what I presented in class on Tuesday.

I went with a handmade (i.e. made in Illustrator) logo because I didn't want to depend on a pixelated/halfhearted version thrown together from Google in PhotoShop.

Even though I liked the idea of the background image in the header, in reality it was too difficult to see the logo, not to mention was acting pretty buggy for me (likely user error, but still...). So I kept the header clean and simple, which I think actually contributes to the children's novel/ illustrated feel I was originally going for.

I liked the layout of the images in my style tile, but in reality they were just too darn hard to see when left in that position at larger screens. So instead I left them stacked.

To keep the right side of the page from feeling too heavy in terms of content, I moved the color blocks into the footer and spanned them the width of the container. I think it helps add a little more balance to the page.

Thanks for your help and for fielding all my email questions!
